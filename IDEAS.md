# Ideas

- Support [`Jinja2`](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/) for those more familiar to that
- Use [`tera`](https://github.com/Keats/tera) as the templating engine
- Use [`gitoxide`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) for git operations
- Use [`octorust`](https://docs.rs/octorust/latest/octorust/) for Github API interactions
- Support other VSC providers (eg: Gitlab, Gitea)
- Pull request template
- Package for [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html)
- Package for [`cargo install`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html)
- Provide a [nix flake, use crane](https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix/part-11#building-catscii-with-nix-build)
